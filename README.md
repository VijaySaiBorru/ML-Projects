# ML-Projects
The following are some Machine Learning projects I made on Jupyter Notebook while learning. 

- Spam SMS Detection:
This is a machine learning model which classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) based on the text it contains.

* Real Estate Prediction:
This is a machine learning model which predicts the price of the houses based on given features.

+ National Anthems Clustering:
This is a machine learning model which makes clusters of the countries using K-Means-Clustering Algorithm and says which are in a same genre.
